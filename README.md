## 🚀 Getting Started
Getting started is simple, just open the Library_Hub.py file in Thonny or any other application that runs Python 3.x or higher
Then create a txt or py file to store your books and thats that, all done

Now when you run the Library_Hub.py program it will prompt you to enter in a file name, an example would be library.txt
It will then display any books you have saved in the file which would be zero if you just started

Once the program has finished loading the books you will be given a menu where you can
1) Add Books
2) Edit Books
3) Add Review
4) Remove Books
5) Search Library
6) Display Library Contents
7) Quit

Each of these choices have prompts within which will guide you through the creation of your books
